# Learning Angular2 to Build Office Add-ins

## Abstract
> If you are in the web development space you have no doubt not ben able to miss all the buzz around Angular. Over the last few years Angular has taken over the web app development space with a vengeance. This year Google is releasing the second version of Angular, Angular 2, and it’s a huge change from how we built apps with Angular 1.x. The biggest challenge with Angular2 is how many different things there are to get ramped up on from the new syntax, module loaders, to TypeScript or to stick with JavaScript, you name it. But these are all good things and in reality, the surface area of Angular2 is much smaller than Angular 1.x. In this demo heavy session you will get your feet wet as we demystify and build our first Angular2 app. We will build this as an Office Add-in for one of the Office clients. So you’ll walk away learning two things: building apps using Angular2 & building Office Add-ins. What more could you ask for?!
